## Information about documentation files in this folder
The sensor used for this robot is the QTR-8A board. This is the analog version of the sensor.

The Atmel pdf has all of the details on how the microcontroller works. One of the easiest ways to use it is to search for the specific variable or register than you are interested in. For example 'OCR0A'.

The Spark and SparkBOB files show what the microcontroller outputs and inputs are attached to.
